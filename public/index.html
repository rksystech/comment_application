Last year, Rio, Brazil, hosts the Summer Olympic Games. It is six months later now, and Rio does not have enough money.

The stadium has no power, the golf course is not maintained, and the water in the swimming pool is still green. Nobody wants to buy the arenas, so Rio has them. This is also expensive.

The city must pay about $40 million for the Games. This is hard to do. Brazil is still in a depression.

Sadly, the Games are making problems for Rio and its people.
